            <h3>Chapter1 No</h3>
            <p>　　“Please,not in front of my dad!Please!”</p><p>　　Scarlet Preston had been under him countless times,in the bathroom,office,hallway,and park,and every time she begged Marcus Newman to give it to her.</p><p>　　This time,she was also pinned under him,but she cried hoarsely,“No!”</p><p>　　The usual gentle and pleasing are replaced by brutal and harsh,as if the woman under him is just a rag doll.</p><p>　　“No?Do you forget that you will always unbutton your shirt in front of me even when you bring me a cup of coffee and then rub yourself on me?</p><p>　　Do you forget that if you get to my office early,you will pull up your skirt and sit on my lap for a good time?</p><p>　　Now you say no?Pretending to be chaste for your vegetable dad who can't move in his wheelchair?”</p><p>　　After that,Marcus dragged her,naked and hand-tied,to the desk,and the old man,sitting in a wheelchair across the desk,crooked his head,shivering all over,eyes wide!</p><p>　　The old man's mouth was tilted,drooling,his face red,but all voice that came out of his mouth was useless an“Ahh”.</p><p>　　Scarlet tried to dodge,but she was instantly bent over by him in front of the desk.She can only take his fierce thrusts.</p><p>　　She wishes she was dead!</p><p>　　Her father is watching them!</p><p>　　Marcus looked at the old man in the wheelchair,“Mr.Preston,look,your daughter,your only daughter in your life,is being fucked by me,not only that,she has been my lover since her freshman year.If I want her,only a phone call away,she will rush over and strip naked for me to fuck!”</p><p>　　Albert can only emit“Ooh!”sounds.</p><p>　　Scarlet's throat was already hoarse.This man,who had held her in his arms yesterday and called her“baby”,suddenly turned into this.</p><p>　　She couldn't accept it at all.</p><p>　　“Marcus!You can't do this to me!“</p><p>　　“I can't?”Marcus's hand molded her ass,then a slap,continued to torture the woman underneath him.“Mr.Preston,my mother was fooled by you back then,abandoned her husband and her son for you.But what did you do to her?You said she was a slut and you pushed her into the sea,and you claimed that she jumped into the sea for her immoral love!”</p><p>　　“Your baby daughter is a slut now.I bankrupted your company and did not even give her the promise that I would marry her,yet she runs to me and begs me to fuck her every day.Hah,I want her to go down on her knees and suck it,and she will happily kneel and suck my cock hard!What an obedient daughter you have!”</p><p>　　Albert burst into tears,trying to stand up but falling to the ground.</p><p>　　Scarlet never knew that there would be such a feud between Marcus and her father!</p><p>　　So,what were the last ten years?</p><p>　　In her 9th grade,her family went downhill,bankruptcy.She met Marcus when she was in high school,and he has always taken care of her since then.</p><p>　　During freshman year,they had their first night,and since then,he has almost spoiled her.She was an intern at his company,yet he never said he would marry her.</p><p>　　But she knows that her family is bankrupt;she does not have the backing of her family,and if she wants to be Marcus's wife,she must be excellent,so she keeps learning,hoping that one day she will be worthy of him.</p><p>　　She has loved him for ten years!A whole decade!</p><p>　　Scarlet's heart trembled with pain,“Marcus!Why did you lie to me!Why!”</p><p>　　Her cries were too heartbreaking.No one would turn their deaf ears to them.</p><p>　　“Why?Who lets Albert Preston,the monster,who deserves to go to hell,have only one precious daughter?He pushed my mother into the sea,so I made his daughter's life worse than hell.It’s fair,right?”</p><p>　　Scarlet laughed with tears in her eyes.</p><p>　　The man she has loved for ten years,in the end,only wants her to taste his bloody revenge.</p><p>　　Not only is her life worse than hell,but it is more painful than burning in it.</p><p>　　But Scarlet never thought that she would receive a summons from the court just after her strongly mentally stimulated father was admitted to the ICU.</p><p>　　She is accused of the crime of business secret infringement!</p>
            <h3>Chapter2 The leaker</h3>
            <p>　　Scarlet has always loved Marcus.She is his most competent secretary,so how could she help an outsider and leak his company’s secrets?</p><p>　　Plaintiff--Marcus Newman!</p><p>　　Scarlet flopped on the ground,hands and feet froze.If Marcus sues her,then,she is going to jail for sure.</p><p>　　--</p><p>　　CEO's office of Newman Company.</p><p>　　Scarlet pushed open the door and looked at the man behind the desk,handsome and dominant.She walked to him step by step,“For the sake of the past ten years,can you drop your charges?”</p><p>　　Humble,when had she ever been this humble in front of him?</p><p>　　But what happened yesterday,showed her that all that sweet pampering from him was fake.</p><p>　　She is nothing to him.</p><p>　　Scarlet is still wearing her usual secretary's suit,a white blouse,a tight black suit,and a sexy black wrap-around skirt.</p><p>　　She used to look at him,always with an enchanting smile on her face.He said she was a Siren,and he liked it.</p><p>　　But now,there is no light in her eyes.</p><p>　　“If you have any self-respect,you shouldn't have come to me.”Marcus leaned back in his chair,“Hah,how did I forget?You are his daughter,and you started to be my lover for money when you were 18.How can you have self-respect?”</p><p>　　Scarlet's heart tightened as if there was a person you trusted with your life standing behind you,and you walked forward with confidence,but that person stabbed you behind your back unexpectedly.</p><p>　　18?Does he remember that she slept with him on her 18th birthday?</p><p>　　Lover?</p><p>　　She always thought she was her girlfriend,but she didn't realize she was his lover.</p><p>　　Her eyes stung,so stung that hurt,but she never shed a tear in front of him.She kept smiling because he said he liked it,and when she smiled,she was the most beautiful woman in the world.</p><p>　　She walked up to him,her hand propped up on the desk surface,shrugging with seeming ease,“Ten years,even a cat or a dog,you would have feelings toward it,right?”</p><p>　　“But Albert Preston's daughter is not even a cat or a dog.”</p><p>　　Scarlet took a deep breath,and then went between Marcus's legs,knelt,and pulled down his zipper with her fingers,“You withdraw your charges,and I’ll do whatever you want me to do.”</p><p>　　“You think other women won't?”Marcus reached out and cupped Scarlet's chin.</p><p>　　“How can they be as good as me?”Scarlet's eyebrow raised,her hand up and down his bulge,“After all,I've been your lover since 18;it's been 7 years now.7 years,with one look from you,I know whether you want me to be on my back or my stomach,right?”</p><p>　　Scarlet had buried her head.</p><p>　　Every end of Marcus's nerves is highly sensitized,and the warmth and wetness make him exhale a long breath.</p><p>　　He reached out and pressed his hand against her head,his fingers fisting through her hair,trying to pull her away several times,but didn’t make it.</p><p>　　“Scarlet,you're such a whore!Albert Preston saw me fuck you like that yesterday,and you can still suck me like this?”</p><p>　　Scarlet felt that the man above her head was not speaking words,but spewing fire.</p><p>　　He is so cruel,really not caring about the ten years they had been together.</p><p>　　He is so good at acting.He never scolded her in ten years,but in these two days,he used all the vicious and filthy words on her.</p><p>　　He put up with her for ten years in order to get revenge on her family.</p><p>　　Eventually,he succeeded.Her heart was now bleeding.</p><p>　　Scarlet raised her head,her eyes full of lust,and the tip of her pink tongue licked her lips,“I said,as long as you are willing to drop the case,you can do whatever you want to me.”</p>
            <h3>Chapter3 Charges</h3>
            <p>　　But Scarlet was charged with allegedly sexual bribing the plaintiff.</p><p>　　In court,the lawsuit was in full swing,and she firmly denied that she revealed the amount of the bid to Joshua Newman.</p><p>　　She always knew that Joshua was Marcus's arch-rival.</p><p>　　These two brothers have been fighting for many years.</p><p>　　She loves Marcus so much,how could she give his floor price to his rival?</p><p>　　But the man she had loved for ten years submitted all the materials.</p><p>　　“The entire project was handled by Scarlet Preston,and she had email correspondence with the bidder from the competing company,”Marcus said.</p><p>　　After hearing this,Scarlet laughed bitterly,“Marcus,you set me up to get back at my father?The email you asked me to send turned out to be a bidder from the other company?”</p><p>　　Scarlet tilted her head and took a deep breath.</p><p>　　What could be more heartbreaking than being sent to the guillotine by the man you love?</p><p>　　He bents every effort to set the trap so she can never leave,right?</p><p>　　But she couldn’t fall,because she still had to pay her father’s high medical bills.</p><p>　　She had to prove her innocence,have to work and earn money.</p><p>　　She was not involved in the affairs of the last generation,but her father loved her so much that she had to do what a daughter should do,and it was her duty to support him!</p><p>　　Scarlet made herself calm down.Power-wise,she could never win Marcus,but being Marcus's secretary all these years,she has some connections.</p><p>　　Recess Room</p><p>　　Scarlet looked at Marcus,who was personally a witness,“Why do you hate me so much?What have I done to you?Marcus,this decade,I love you with all my heart and soul,isn’t that enough?I love you so much that I want to give my life to you,isn't that enough?”</p><p>　　Scarlet stared into Marcus's eyes,trying to see a little bit of emotion in his eyes.</p><p>　　Yet nothing.</p><p>　　“Scarlet Preston,this case whether you appeal or not,you will go into jail for sure.But if you appeal,there is still some time.Next week is my engagement party with Lily White,which you can still attend,and then the trial.”</p><p>　　Scarlet shook her head,“What did you say?You and Lily?”</p><p>　　Scarlet's voice trembled.</p><p>　　Marcus turned his head to her,“Do you want an invitation?”</p><p>　　Scarlet took a few steps back and fell into a chair,“You know full well that Lily is my cousin.She and I have never got along.Do you have to go this far?”</p><p>　　“Do I still need to consult you on who I should marry?”</p><p>　　She never has a place in his heart.He never thought of marrying her.</p><p>　　Even though these years,she is used to see all the ugliness in the business world,openly and secretly,she always believes what she has with Marcus is pure.</p><p>　　The dream woke up,and the bubble burst.It’s so hurt.</p><p>　　She can’t breathe.</p><p>　　Scarlet's phone rang.It was the hospital.“Miss.Preston.The patient's heart suddenly stopped.We gave first aid,but he has no vital signs.You know of his condition when the patient was sent to the hospital.We tried our best,but the patient has no sense of survival...”</p><p>　　Before Scarlet hung up the phone,she calmly said“thank you,”as if she was just hanging up a real estate agent's phone.</p><p>　　She walked past Marcus and out the door.</p><p>　　The trial started again;Scarlet was so calm that she didn’t look like a bit of the professional elite who refused to admit her guilt before.She quietly stood at the defendant's table and listened to the judge's statement.</p><p>　　“Defendant!”</p><p>　　Scarlet came back to her senses.She did not look at the judge,but looked at Marcus.She smiled,very sweet,just like when they first met,she called him“brother Marcus.”</p><p>　　“Brother Marcus,my father is dead,and so is your mother.He suffered enough before he died,and I'm also going to jail.My father's sins,did he pay with interest back to you?For these ten years,I do not blame you lied to me.Father debt,daughter pay,I admit.”</p><p>　　“From now on,we are even!The past ten years,I will forget like we never meet...,”Scarlet tears fell,she turned her head to look at the judge,and choked but resoundingly firm,“I plead guilty!”</p>
            <h3>Chapter4 Guilty</h3>
            <p>　　I plead guilty!</p><p>　　All of it,her father's,her own.</p><p>　　The Scarlet that Marcus knows is flirtatious in bed,yet keen-witted and capable at work,and she will never admit defeat.</p><p>　　He originally thought that this case would last a long time,and with Scarlet's nature,she would not give up until she reached her goal.</p><p>　　When Scarlet said,“I plead guilty,”Marcus was in a trance.After the case closed,he sat here for a long time before standing up.</p><p>　　His mind buzzes with confusion.</p><p>　　“From now on,we are even.”</p><p>　　Even?</p><p>　　Ten years,even?</p><p>　　“I will forget the last ten years......”</p><p>　　Never met?</p><p>　　He hadn't seen her cry until the day her father was admitted to the ICU,and now all he could think about was the tears on her face.</p><p>　　Marcus shrugged,“We are even!”</p><p>　　He took one step away from the plaintiff's stand but almost tumbled.</p><p>　　He recalled the determination with which she uttered those three words,as if she had slammed the project contract on the table with her,“This project has to be mine!”</p><p>　　It's a must!</p><p>　　Scarlet,there is nothing she can't do.</p><p>　　Marcus tugged on his tie and walked out of the courtroom.There will be no more Scarlet in his life.</p><p>　　--</p><p>　　Prison</p><p>　　Scarlet's mouth was bleeding while she straddled another woman's body.The shoe in his hand slapped on the woman’s face:“Will you come near me again!”</p><p>　　“NO!NO!”</p><p>　　“Will you dump what you don’t want to eat on my dinner plate again?”After saying that,there were two more“slaps”.</p><p>　　“No!No!”She begged for mercy repeatedly.</p><p>　　Scarlet practiced judo.She couldn’t beat Marcus,but the woman was not her opponent.</p><p>　　In a place like a prison,it's inevitable that people will bully her,the new girl,and she wanted to put things to rest,but these sons of bitches pushed too much!</p><p>　　This prestige,she must set up,or anyone can climb to her head in the future.</p><p>　　In this world,only Marcus can bully her and leave her defenseless.</p><p>　　But she can only be hurt by him once!</p><p>　　This is the only time!</p><p>　　All the female inmates were afraid of Scarlet because she was as fierce as a mother fucker.</p><p>　　When Scarlet learned she was pregnant,she was at her wits'end;she didn't know what to do.</p><p>　　When Adam Shaw visited Scarlet in the prison,Scarlet finally saw hope,and she looked at Adam through the thick glass,praying,“Adam,please help me.”</p><p>　　Scarlet lost so much weight that she now looked like a skeleton.Adam’s lips trembled with anger,“Why would Marcus do this to you?What does he want?I thought he really loved you when he warned me not to go near you.And I let go because I saw the way you looked at him.Why did you end up in jail!”</p><p>　　Adam's eye reddened,“Scarlet!You stupid woman!”</p><p>　　Scarlet pursed her lips tightly,“If I hadn't experienced it,how would I know I was stupid?Everything has its cause and effect.Let's not mention the past.”</p><p>　　“Not mention?Why not mention it?He sent you to jail with his own hands!Why not?”</p><p>　　“I owe him.It's time to pay him back.”Scarlet took a deep breath as she tried not to let her tears flow out,“Now we are even.”</p><p>　　Adam wanted to say something else,but he swallowed it back.</p><p>　　Scarlet said,“Help me think of a way,you must can.I'm pregnant.Don't let the people outside find out about my pregnancy,and even if they do,help me find a way to prove that the child is someone else's.”</p><p>　　“Marcus's child?”</p><p>　　“Yes.”</p><p>　　“Why not abort it?”</p><p>　　“I can't.”</p><p>　　“Why?”</p><p>　　“I will not fall in love with anyone ever.Man,I have enough.But the child is mine.”Scarlet looked at Adam's eyes and her tears finally pouring out.</p><p>　　Adam's fist,viciously smashed on the stone platform,“You actually denied every man for him?”</p><p>　　“At least for now.”</p><p>　　Adam knew that Scarlet was hurt to the core,and she must now adjust herself.He couldn’t push her.</p><p>　　“I will help you.”</p><p>　　----</p><p>　　The day when Scarlet was in labor,the doctor frowned and performed a Caesarean section on her,“Economic crime.They are very smart people;how can they not see this?Waste your valuable freedom just for some money?”</p><p>　　“Hey,so young,and only one kidney left.”</p><p>　　Only one kidney is left.</p><p>　　Scarlet heard the doctor's conversation in a daze.</p><p>　　In court,she accused,“Isn't it enough that I will give my life to you?”</p><p>　　Marcus Newman,how can you be so cruel to me?</p><p>　　Fortunately,we are even.</p>
